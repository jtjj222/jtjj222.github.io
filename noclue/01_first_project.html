<h1 id="our-first-project---rpn-calculator">Our First Project - RPN Calculator</h1>
<p>Let’s start off with a small project to get you caught up. We will be building a simple reverse-polish-notation calculator, demonstrating how we can move from requirements to a solution. This example will be in Java, but you can follow along in any imperative programming language. If you don’t understand anything, look it up. I will try to give you tips to help you with your research.</p>
<h2 id="what-is-reverse-polish-notation">What is Reverse Polish Notation?</h2>
<p>Reverse Polish Notation is a way of specifying mathematical expressions without using brackets. It was commonly used during the 70s on calculators.</p>

<p>Numbers are pushed to a stack in order from left to right. Imagine each number like a plate on top of a stack of dishes. Whenever an operator is encountered, it takes its operands off the top of the stack and pushes the result. Here are a few example calculations</p>
<pre><code>3 4 +
&gt;7

5 4 3 * +
&gt;17

6 3 /
&gt;2

5 10 * 6 + 4 /
&gt;14

5 10 * 6
&gt; 50, 6</code></pre>
<p>Our program will take output produce output like above. It will take an expression as input, and output the current stack.</p>
<h2 id="what-is-a-stack">What is a Stack?</h2>
<p>A stack is a very common data structure in Computer Science. There are two common ways a stack can be implemented - using an array or a linked list.</p>
<p>TODO Image</p>
<p>We will discuss data structures later on. For our RPN Calculator, we will use the built-in stack implementation for our language (<code>java.util.Stack</code> in Java) to avoid duplicated effort. This is generally a good idea when programming - be lazy.</p>
<h2 id="how-will-we-organize-our-program">How will we organize our program?</h2>
<p>The goal of this example is to give you experience breaking apart a problem into smaller problems. Our program will have a few main parts. It will need to:</p>
<ul>
<li>Loop to read user input</li>
<li>Split up the input into tokens (i.e <code>5 10+</code> would become <code>[5, 10, +]</code>) - notice how a space isn’t necessary between tokens.</li>
<li>Implement the four basic operations - <code>+, -, *, /</code></li>
<li>Output the stack to the screen</li>
</ul>
<p>Try this yourself before looking at my solution. If you get stuck, here are some hints.</p>
<h2 id="finding-tokens">Finding tokens</h2>
<p>My suggestion would be to loop over every character in the input. If it is an operator, add it as a separate token. Otherwise, append it to the current token.</p>
<h2 id="processing-tokens">Processing tokens</h2>
<p>Be careful! Order matters for subtraction and division. <code>10 5 -</code> is 5, not -5. Remember that items at the top of the stack were added last (First In, First Out).</p>
<h2 id="my-solution">My Solution</h2>
<p>Here is my first implementation. I can’t stress enough how important it is for you to try this yourself first.</p>
<pre><code class="ext-code java" data-src="examples/01/src/RPN.java">Downloading Code Example...</code></pre>
<p>Let’s see how we can make it cleaner.</p>
<p>TODO</p>
<h2 id="what-did-we-learn">What did we learn?</h2>
<p>Always remember that there is room for improvement. Until next time, happy coding!</p>
