<h1 id="introduction">Introduction</h1>
<p>Welcome! This book is meant to help you grow as a Computer Scientist, by exposing you to a broad range of topics. This book is for you if you know a bit about programming, but you have no clue how to put everything you know together to approach a new problem.</p>
<h2 id="status">Status</h2>
<p>This is a very early work in progress. You shouldn’t be reading this unless you would like to contribute. View the current version <a href="http://github.justinmichaud.com/noclue/index.html">here</a>.</p>
<h2 id="why">Why?</h2>
<p>There are many great resources that can take someone from knowing nothing about programming to having a basic understanding of a programming language (there are also a lot of terrible ones designed to part people with their money). There are also a large number of resources for people studying Mathematics and Computer Science in University. This book hopes to fill the gap between them.</p>
<h2 id="who-am-i">Who am I?</h2>
<p>I’m just a boring student from Canada. I will be entering my first year at the University of Waterloo in September 2016 to study Computer Science. I know how to program, but in the grand scheme of things, I am still just a beginner myself. This book is mostly about documenting my learning as I become a better Computer Scientist.</p>
<p>So far, all of my Computer Science education has been self-taught. When you aren’t exposed to more challenging material, it is easy to believe that you are a good programmer. The fact of life is that experience really is key, and you need to make sure that you gain many years of experience, not one year many times.</p>
<h2 id="how-are-the-examples-organized">How are the examples organized?</h2>
<p>Each example is designed to be self-contained, and relevant to many different programming languages. The example solutions written by me will be mostly in Java, because that is the language I am most comfortable with. The examples will probably not be the best possible solution, so if you can improve them, please feel free to contribute.</p>
<h2 id="lets-get-started">Let’s Get Started!</h2>
<p>With that out of the way, let’s go!</p>
